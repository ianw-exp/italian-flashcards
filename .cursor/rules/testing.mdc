# Testing

## After Making Code Changes

1. **Run all tests**  
   Once you are done making changes to the codebase, run the full test suite and ensure all tests pass. Fix any failures before considering the task complete.

2. **Offer to add tests for new functionality**  
   After finishing changes, proactively ask the user: *"Should I also write new tests to cover the new functionality?"* Do this when you’ve added or changed behavior that could benefit from tests, rather than waiting for the user to ask.

## Examples

- After adding a new API endpoint → run tests, then ask if you should add tests for that endpoint.
- After refactoring a module → run tests to confirm nothing broke, then ask if you should add or update tests for the refactored behavior.
- After fixing a bug → run tests, then ask if you should add a regression test for that bug.
